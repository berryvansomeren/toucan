The first step is to load our image

Then we apply a uniform sampling to get a low-poly basis.

By sampling the edges we bring back a bit more detail.

Finally to bring back some final highlights we sample some keypoints.

Don't forget to save your results using the button in the bottom right. 

Have fun!!
